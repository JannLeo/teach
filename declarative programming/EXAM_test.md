#### Question 1: Haskell Basics [16 marks]

For each of the following Haskell expressions, provide the type or indicate if it results in an error:

1.1. `:t (==)`  











1.2. `:t map (*2)`  









1.3. `map Just`  







1.4. `:t (++ [1, 2])`  







1.5. `\x -> x []`  







1.6. `:t (++)`  





1.7. `flip filter [1,2,3]`  





1.8. `:t head`

#### Question 2: Haskell Evaluation [12 marks]

For each Haskell expression below, provide its value or explain why it results in an error. Assume `Data.List` is loaded.

2.1. `map length ["Hi", "World"]`  







2.2. `filter (odd) [1,2,3,4,5]`  







2.3. `let e = head [] in 5`  







2.4. `map snd $ zip [1,2,3] ["a","b"]`  







2.5. `foldr (:) [0] [1, 2, 3]`  







2.6. `foldl (flip (:)) [] [1, 2, 3]`









---

#### Question 3: Functional Trees [20 marks]

Define a Haskell function `treeSum :: TTree Int -> Int` that calculates the sum of all values in a binary tree. Use the following type for binary trees:

```haskell
data TTree a = Nil | Node a (TTree a) (TTree a)
```

Additionally, write a function `isBalanced :: TTree a -> Bool` that checks if a tree is balanced. A tree is balanced if, for each node, the height difference between its left and right subtrees is at most one.

















---

#### Question 4: Prolog Basics [12 marks]

For each Prolog expression, state what will be printed or explain why it will fail:

4.1. `member(X, [1,2,3,4])`  







4.2. `length([a,b,c], 4)`  







4.3. `append([X|_], [Y|_], [1,2,3])`  









4.4. `X = 3 * 7`









---

#### Question 5: Prolog List Operations [20 marks]

Write a Prolog predicate `reverse_list(L, R)` that reverses a list. For example:

```prolog
?- reverse_list([1,2,3], R).
R = [3,2,1].
```

Additionally, write a Prolog predicate `is_palindrome(L)` that checks if a list is a palindrome. A list is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.















---

#### Question 6: Functional Programming in Haskell [20 marks]

Write a Haskell function `subsequences :: [a] -> [[a]]` that returns all subsequences of a list in the order they appear. For instance:

```haskell
subsequences [1,2] = [[], [1], [2], [1,2]]
```

Additionally, implement `powerset :: [a] -> [[a]]` that returns the power set of a list, which includes all possible combinations of the listâ€™s elements.



















---

#### Question 7: Prolog Tree Operations [20 marks]

Define a Prolog predicate `tree_member(X, Tree)` that checks if an element `X` exists in a binary tree. The tree will use the following structure:

```prolog
tree(nil).
tree(node(Left, Value, Right)) :- tree(Left), tree(Right).
```

Also, write a predicate `tree_height(Tree, H)` that calculates the height of a binary tree, where `nil` has height 0, and a `node` has height 1 plus the maximum height of its subtrees.
